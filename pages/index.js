              <p>
                The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
                Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer
                to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in
                length, separated by short breaks.

                concentrated for long periods of time? Simply use the focus
                session. Pick a time and get to work!

              <p>
                See how long you've stayed focused, what's your longest session,
                how many sessions were completed successfully, how many were
                interrupted, etc. This helps you stay motivated and improve your
                work environment.

                You can access Focus's Leaderboard and join the competition for
                the most persistent! It is optional as it makes your focus time
                public, but it's a fun way to see your progress while
                participating in a friendly competition.

          <div style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
            <h3>Who's behind Focus?</h3>
            <p>
              Me! I'm Dominic Fournier, a software engineering student from
              Canada. I'm always looking for interested developers to work with,
              but for now, I am the sole developer of Focus.
            </p>
            <h3>How is this service free?</h3>
            <p>
              There are no fees attached to running Focus. Free of charge
              services are used for our current infrastructure. I also build it
              as a personnal project, so I handle the cost of development,
              because I believe that productivity and dedication from all will
              help build a better tomorrow.
            </p>
            <h3>How can I use Focus?</h3>
            <p>
              Right now, Focus is only available as a{" "}
              <a href="https://discord.com/new">Discord</a> bot. If you're
              interested in using it, you need to create your own Discord server
              or ask your server administrator to add the bot. Instructions on
              installing Discord bots can be found{" "}
              <a href="https://www.techjunkie.com/discord-install-bots/">
                here
              </a>
              .
            </p>
            <h3>What about the privacy of my data?</h3>
            <p>
              Focus only stores minimal information about you, just enough to
              work. Your full discord username (ie.: Adam#1234), Identifier,
              your server Identifier and the URL to your discord avatar are
              stored, that's it. Your study sessions are also stored (length and
              date). This data is not and will not be used for profit in any
              way.
