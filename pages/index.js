              <p>
                The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
                Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer
                to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in
                length, separated by short breaks.

                participating in a friendly competition.

            <h3>Who's behind Focus?</h3>
            <p>
              Focus is a collaborative, Open-Source project. That means that
              nobody owns it. It also means that it is developed and maintained
              by any willing developer!
            </p>
            <h3>How is this service free?</h3>
            <p>
              There are no fees attached to running Focus. For our
              infrastructure, we targeted services that are free of charge for
              our current scale and the people building it do it for free. Also,
              there is no monetary intent behind the project, we simply believe
              that productivity and dedication from all will help build a better
              tomorrow.
            </p>
            <h3>How can I use Focus?</h3>
            <p>
              Right now, Focus is only available as a{" "}
              <a href="https://discord.com/new">Discord</a> bot. If you're
              interested in using it, you need to create your own Discord server
              or ask your server administrator to add the bot. Instructions on
